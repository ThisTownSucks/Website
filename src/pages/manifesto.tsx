    <h2>This town… sucks.</h2>

    <p>
      The options of communication tools, social media platforms, and DIY
      resources don’t cut it. What’s worse, they don’t address the particular
      needs of artists, fans and venues.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fans want to know where shows are happening. They want to know when bands
      they like are coming to town. They want to be able to get their favorite
      bands to play in their area. They want a meaningful way to express that
      interest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bands want to know if this town will be a worthwhile stop. They want to
      know if a venue is welcoming to their genre. They want to know who’s
      available to open for them and the size and make-up of the crowd they can
      expect.
    </p>

    <p>
      Venues want to know which bands people are most interested in seeing. They
      want to know what kind of turnout to expect. They want to know but about
      the interests of the fans in their area and the make-up of the market in
      which they’re embedded.
    </p>

    <p>
      Historically, bands have had to make cold-calls, send instant messages to
      strangers, beg to play a show in a town where they’ve never been, with no
      guarantee that the person booking will put any effort toward promotion.
      It’s often a loss for the band and the venue. Most bands make up for the
      costs of touring by selling merchandise, but if the show is a bust,
      they’re out a lot of money. It’s a huge stress on the band. A lot of bands
      end up breaking up because of bad experiences on tour.
    </p>

    <p>
      Likewise, fans get a generic interface with basic, manually entered, often
      incomplete information about show times and venue location, and a vague
      way to indicate interest in attending, only to never get a reminder from
      the platform. That “I’m going” was just another dopamine hit for the event
      creator, and not a meaningful exchange of intent. Bands and venues are
      left disappointed when the real attendance didn’t match their
      expectations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Venues form around expectations of audiences that may or may not exist.
      They often make business decisions based on incomplete knowledge. They
      often rely on booking agents or agencies whose interests might not always
      be aligned.
    </p>

    <p>
      We think there’s an opportunity for venues to better serve the communities
      they support, while also having more direct contact with the artists and
      fans who compose it. There is more music to be made, more shows to be
      played, and more fans to be reached. We want to give artists, venues, and
      fans an unobscured view of the musical landscape around them.
